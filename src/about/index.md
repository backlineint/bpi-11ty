As is likely obvious by now, I enjoy doing computer-y things, specifically web development. I work for a digital agency called [Bounteous](https://bounteous.com) and my current title is Associate Principle Architect. I don't know what that title means either, but I work primarily within our Drupal practice leading front end development efforts. I'm also an active member of the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org/community), [speaking at events](https://noti.st/brianperry) and [contributing back to the Drupal ecosystem.](https://www.drupal.org/u/brianperry) Over my nearly ten years working with Drupal I have primarily focused my efforts on approaches to component based development.    

I currently live in the Chicago Suburbs, but I was born and raised on the East Coast. I grew up in Rhode Island and lived outside of Boston for years before migrating to the Midwest. Speaking of past me, [I performed comedy for years in the Boston area](https://www.improvboston.com/) and beyond. I haven't done that in years, but am always up for a good joke over Zoom.

I'm lucky enough to live with a great family - one rad wife, one whatever kids say to mean cool son, and two legendary cats. I love video games and am a major Nintendo fanboy. I enjoy distance running, coffee, and am suprisingly serious about a good bagel.

My greatest dream is that this site is useful to people, including the future version of me (who I can only assume will be named president of the internet.)
