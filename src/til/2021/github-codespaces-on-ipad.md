Add [remote containers plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

F1, search for 'Add Development Container Configuration Files...'

Select a container configuration definition (Node in this case)

Pick your node version.

Commit the files in .devcontainer

Push to github

Create your codespace.

Is it possible to have a start script? I had to NPM install, etc.

Photo of setup

Codespaces with magic keyboard is a really nice experience.

What is coming in iOS 15 now that M1 is in iPad pro?

Want to get back to working on Drupal codespace.
