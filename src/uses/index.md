Inspired by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses) and [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/), this is a living document that outlines all of the hardware, software, and other gadgets that I use in my day-to-day setup. It would be icing on the cake if others find this useful, but I mainly maintain it for my future self when setting up a new machine.

## Hardware

* Personal - 2020 M1 MacBook Pro 13' - Apple Silicon is the real deal. This is the first Mac in quite a while that I truly love using.
* Work - 2020 Intel MacBook Pro 16' - Rocked a 2015 15' MacBook pro for a very long time. Even though this is kind of an awkward time to take on a new intel Mac, my trusty 2015 was barely limping along.
* Tablet - 10.5' iPad Pro
* Phone - iPhone 12 Pro - I'm one of those jerks on the iPhone upgrade plan.

## IDE

In 2020 I made the switch from PHP Storm to VS Code. I actually keep PHP Storm around to use for their merge conflict resolution tool, which is much better than VS Code. Hopefully that will change eventually.

Here are some of the VS Code extensions I rely on:

* [Markdown All In One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)

## Apps and Utilities

I keep a pretty stock Mac config, but can't live without the following:

* [Unclutter](https://unclutterapp.com/) - Keeps the digital mess hidden away. Without this installed, my Mac feels broken.
* Evernote
* All Things Done
* Sonos
