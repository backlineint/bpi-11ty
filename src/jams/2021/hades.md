[Hades](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/) has hooked me in a way that no [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike#:~:text=Roguelike%20(or%20rogue%2Dlike),death%20of%20the%20player%20character.) before has. There has been no shortage of virtual ink spilled on [why this game is so great](https://www.polygon.com/22167819/hades-game-of-the-year-2020), but for me it comes down to a few main things: improvisational combat, evolving systems, and story.

### Improvisational combat

Hades strongly encourages you to play with different loadouts. While I have favorites, I still have fun playing regardless of the weapon I choose at the start of my run. That combined with the insane variety of upgrades you'll earn, you really won't know what combat style you'll be leaning on until it presents itself to you. This makes every run feel surprising and fun.
