Hard to pin the sound down on this one, so I'm not even going to try.

After a mood setting intro the album opens up with two absolutely killer songs:

Having those two massive songs up front initially made things feel really front loaded, but this album has been a real grower for me that has balanced out over time. Looking forward to following his work in the future.
