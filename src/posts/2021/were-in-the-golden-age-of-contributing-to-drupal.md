I spent a little time yesterday looking at the new [general project type on Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_general). As someone who spends quite a bit of time working on Drupal adjacent things, a home for Drupal related projects that aren't modules or themes opens up some exciting (and important) possibilities. As I thought more about how this could be used for an upcoming project, it dawned on me that this was just latest in a series of developments that vastly improve the experience of contributing to Drupal. 

I'm sure other Drupal lifers can think of older milestones, but my personal turning point goes back about four years ago to [when the project application process was updated](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalorg/issues/2666584) so that any user would have the ability to create a full project on Drupal.org. Prior to that, the process to create a new project felt insurmountable (at least to younger me.) Drupal activity will never reach the 50 NPM packages that were probably created while you read this paragraph, but reducing the barrier to entry made a big difference.

Fast forward a few years and the hits just keep on coming.

Unquestionably the biggest 

Now merge requests / Patches are odd.

Renewed efforts in simplytest / Tugboat

Local environment setups 

Cloud local environments 

And general projects  

Took work from many to get here. Thanks!
