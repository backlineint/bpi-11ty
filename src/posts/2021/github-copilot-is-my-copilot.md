I can’t resist blog post titles that would make a really stupid bumper sticker.

I realized a few days ago that I had access to the GitHub Copilot preview. Without any hesitation I turned it on. After a few minutes that were a mix of amazement and confusion, I turned it off.

If you haven’t heard about Copilot, it is… It also has sparked some ethical concerns.

Back to me. While github copilot was off, I was left thinking of the way you communicated to it via clear comments and function signatures. Maybe I should be writing all the time like this.

So I turned it back on. With my expectations tempered, I found that I really liked what essentially feels like a more intelligent autocomplete. I’ve learned to ignore when it is wrong, which is often. But when it suggests the chunk of code I need, it feels like magic.

Wrapping comment on ethical concerns.
