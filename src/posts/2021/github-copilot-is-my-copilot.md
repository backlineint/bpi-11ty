I can’t resist blog post titles that would make a really stupid bumper sticker.

If you haven’t heard about [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/), it is a plugin for Visual Studio Code that uses AI to autosuggest code as you type. It sounds too good to be true, so of course I signed up for the technical preview to find out for myself.

A few days ago  I realized that I had been granted access to Copilot. Without any hesitation I turned it on. After a few minutes that were a mix of amazement and confusion, I turned it off.

Why? Honestly, I mostly found the suggestions it was making to my code disorienting. I'm obviously familiar with my typical thought process, but Copilot was trying to lead me in different directions. The frequency of suggestions was also distracting. The site describes Copilot as 'your AI pair programmer.' I'm not as comfortable with pair programming as I should be, but imagine if you were pair programming but your partner was suggesting things every time you typed. 

The final issue that motivated me to turn it off was accuracy. I found that the things it was suggesting were typically not what I wanted. Following the examples shown on the site, I also tried providing guidance to Copilot via comments. I found that those comments had to be pretty elaborate, and even then it was mainly resulting in large blocks of code that wasn't what I wanted.

Since it was mainly distracting me and breaking my flow, Copilot had to go.

A funny thing happened after I turned it off though. I kept thinking about my new friend copilot.

Back to me. While github copilot was off, I was left thinking of the way you communicated to it via clear comments and function signatures. Maybe I should be writing all the time like this.

So I turned it back on. With my expectations tempered, I found that I really liked what essentially feels like a more intelligent autocomplete. I’ve learned to ignore when it is wrong, which is often. But when it suggests the chunk of code I need, it feels like magic.

Trains well.
