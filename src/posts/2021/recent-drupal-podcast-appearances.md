I've been lucky enough to be a guest on a few Drupal related podcasts recently, continuing my long standing trend of talking to anyone who will listen.

[Drupal Easy Podcast](https://www.drupaleasy.com/podcast): Back in January, Mike Anello had me on to talk about Front End Components on [Episode 238](https://www.drupaleasy.com/podcast/2021/01/drupaleasy-podcast-238-front-end-components-beginners-brian-perry). We mostly focused on the basics, which was a nice change of pace compared to the component integration talk I had been giving recently.

[Talking Drupal](https://talkingdrupal.com/): the folks at Talking Drupal recently decided to have a rotating co-host seat for four week stretches and were nice enough to invite me to be the first to occupy the seat. Thus far I've been around to chat about:

* [Starting a Drupal Career](https://talkingdrupal.com/282) with Mike Anello (I swear Mike is following me)
* [Tugboat](https://www.tubgoat.qa/) with Matt Westgate

The biggest development across these two episodes is that I've gotten my mic quality on point. Two more episodes to go!

On the topic of podcasts, I'd recommend the following two non-Drupal podcasts from this week that I thought were especially great:
* [Shop Talk Show 451](https://shoptalkshow.com/451/): JavaScript and Web Components with Nolan Lawson
* [Syntax 330](https://syntax.fm/show/330/react-query-more-react-with-tanner-linsley): React Query + More React with Tanner Linsley
